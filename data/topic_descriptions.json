Because when I look up in the universe, I know I'm small but I'm also big. I'm big because I'm connected to the universe, and the universe is connected to me.\n\nAny time scientists disagree, it's because we have insufficient data. Then we can agree on what kind of data to get; we get the data; and the data solves the problem. Either I'm right, or you're right, or we're both wrong. And we move on. That kind of conflict resolution does not exist in politics or religion.\n\nI'm often asked - and occasionally in an accusatory way - 'Are you atheist?' And it's like, 'You know, the only 'ist' I am is a scientist, all right?' I don't associate with movements. I'm not an 'ism.' I just - I think for myself.","id":2},{"topic":"corporate landlords","headline":"Investigating corporate landlords","description":"Corporate landlords are companies that buy, sell, own and rent out homes for profit. Generally speaking, there are two kinds of such companies: investment funds (like Blackstone and Cerberus) and housing corporations (like Akelius and Vonovia). Corporate landlords are thought to be the biggest private landlords in many European cities and even whole countries.\n\nIn a time of housing crises across European cities, we believe it's important to know what role corporate landlords play in and what their impact is on housing markets. To get a comprehensive view of such issues, we believe these data are required:\n- Evolution of capital flows into housing markets across cities and countries.\n- Evolution of the number of homes bought, sold and owned by corporate landlords across cities.\n- Addresses and date of acquisition of homes owned by corporate landlords in a given city.\n- Evolution over a periof of time in a given city of:\n-- the population and the number of homes;\n-- the share of home ownership by individuals, companies, other organisations, and the state;\n-- the share of home ownership by type of company (investment fund, REIT, bank, housing corporation...);\n-- the share of home-owner-occupiers and tenants;\n-- rental and property prices;\n-- the share of household income devoted to rent (or generally to housing);\n-- the share of people overburdened by housing costs.\n\nAnd there are always additional data that can contribute to get a more in-depth view, like comparing the different regulations and tax regimes in place affecting corporate landlords, housing investment and the property and rental markets; and the financial results of corporate landlords over time.\n\nFinally, to be able to understand and visualise cross-border patterns, the data compiled and analysed need to be comparable, which in the case of cities can be quite challenging. We tried to take the first steps towards gathering the required data and starting to get a comprehensive view of the topic of corporate landlords in Europe with the Cities for Rent investigation.","id":3},{"topic":null,"headline":null,"description":null,"id":4},{"topic":null,"headline":null,"description":null,"id":5},{"topic":null,"headline":null,"description":null,"id":6},{"topic":null,"headline":null,"description":null,"id":7},{"topic":null,"headline":null,"description":null,"id":8},{"topic":null,"headline":null,"description":null,"id":9},{"topic":null,"headline":null,"description":null,"id":10},{"topic":null,"headline":null,"description":null,"id":11},{"topic":null,"headline":null,"description":null,"id":12},{"topic":null,"headline":null,"description":null,"id":13},{"topic":null,"headline":null,"description":null,"id":14},{"topic":null,"headline":null,"description":null,"id":15},{"topic":null,"headline":null,"description":null,"id":16},{"topic":null,"headline":null,"description":null,"id":17},{"topic":null,"headline":null,"description":null,"id":18},{"topic":null,"headline":null,"description":null,"id":19},{"topic":null,"headline":null,"description":null,"id":20}]
